- Background color: Very dark gray (#0F172A), near black, provides a modern, high-contrast backdrop that makes other elements stand out. Its hue is related to that of the primary color, and the color scheme follows a dark scheme.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#A855F7) to highlight key interactive elements, offering a modern contrast and signifying creativity and innovation.  It is analogous to the primary color, shifted in hue and made more vivid.
- Body: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font to maintain a modern, neutral, and objective look; also suitable for headlines.
- Use a clean, modern grid layout to showcase projects and services, ensuring a balance between content and white space.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations for transitions and hovers to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
- Utilize a set of minimalist icons from Remixicon to represent different sections and functionalities, keeping the design consistent and professional.
